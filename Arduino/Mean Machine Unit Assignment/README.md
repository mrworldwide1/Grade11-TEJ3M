Mean Machine Project
</h1>

Project collab for the TEJ3M Computer Engineering course, between Archisman Nath and Lucas L., creating an Arduino cardboard machine that puts a peice of candy on a platform and pulls it away via servos when someone tries to grab it. 
This project was completed as an end of unit assignment for TEJ3MR. It uses the arduino microcontroller to simulate the opening and closing of a draw bridge.

Currently using:
* Servos
* Ultrasonic distance sensor
* Arduino UNO
